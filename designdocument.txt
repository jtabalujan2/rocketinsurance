1. Main App
2. Rating Screen (User Input)
3. Quote Screen (Based on API Call)

Components:
    1. Main App - Class
    2. Rating Screen - Function
    3. Quote Screen - Function
    4. Buttons - Function
    5. Loading Screen - Function


Flow:
    - Parent will contain main state and pass state as props to children;
        - also pass functions to retrieve values from children
    - Children will have functions to pass values back and allow for a controlled form design

state = {
    userData: {
        firstName : string,
        lastName : string,
        address : {
            line_1 : string,
            line_2 : string,
            city : string,
            region : string,
            postal: string 
        }
    },
    policyCoverages: {
        deductible : int
        asteroid_collision : int
    }
}

Rerender will occur:
1. when data is updated in the rating screen (state change)
2. when person presses quote button (state change + invoke url change)
3. when loading screen is done (state change)
4. policy coverages are changed (state change)
